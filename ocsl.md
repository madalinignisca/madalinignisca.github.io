## Preamble

The OpenCommunity Software License (OCSL) is a free software license that allows for free use, modification and distribution of the software by individuals and small organizations, while prohibiting commercial usage by larger entities to promote a fair and equitable access to open source technology. This license is based on the European Union Public Licence (EUPL-1.2).

## Definitions

1. "Software" means the work of authors subject to the terms of this License that is provided with a copy of this License or is available for downloading under the terms of this License through a publicly accessible network site and includes any modifications or updates to this Software made available under the terms of this License.
2. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or entity exercising rights granted by this License who has received a copy of this license and is therefore bound by its terms.
3. "Larger Entity" means any company, organization, or entity that employs more than 10 persons full-time.
4. "Fork" means the development and distribution of a separate project based on the original project under this License.

## Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, You are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to do the following:

1. To reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, prepare derivative works based upon, and sublicense copies of the Software, in any medium now known or hereafter developed, under the condition that the forks are only allowed for contribution back to the project and not for creating an alternative project.
2. To allow Larger Entities to use the software on a non-commercial basis (for internal research, development, testing, demonstration, or educational purposes).
3. To use the Software for personal, academic, and non-commercial purposes.

## Conditions for Using the Software

1. You must reproduce in all copies of the Software your name, a unique identifier for this copy of the Software (if any), and a notice indicating that the Software is licensed under OCSL Version 1.0.
2. If You create or distribute Derivative Works, You must retain, in each such work, all copyright notices originally included in the Software.
3. If the Software was designed or intended for use with a computer system, and if Your Derivative Work also requires interaction with a computer system, then the Derivative Work must either be distributed under the same licensing terms as this Software, or You must provide a written offer to convey the essential information necessary to enable the recipient to reproduce the Derivative Work in source code form.
4. If You create and distribute Derivative Works that are static combinations of the Software with other software (such as by linking or embedding), Your distribution must not be structured in such a way as to hide the origin or authorship of the Software from the recipient.
5. Larger Entities may use the Software for non-commercial purposes only, provided that they comply with all terms and conditions of this License. Failure to comply will result in the immediate loss of rights granted by this license and may result in legal action.
6. If You distribute copies or modifications of this Software under this License, You must make it clear that this Software is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored or approved by any Larger Entity.
7. Redistributions of source code form must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

## Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Termination

This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Upon termination, You must immediately destroy or remove all copies of the Software in Your possession or under Your control and certify in writing to the licensor that you have done so.

## Miscellaneous

This license represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof between the parties and supersedes all prior communications, representations and agreements regarding this subject matter. Any ambiguities in this license shall not be interpreted against the licensor but instead in favor of the party adverse to such ambiguity. This License may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both parties hereto. If any provision of this license is held unenforceable, such provision will be struck and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The failure by either party to enforce any right or provision hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or provision. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Country], without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.
