_I asked ChatGPT when is the best time of the day to do city photography?_

The best time to do city photography is during the "golden hour," which is the hour just after sunrise and the hour just before sunset. During this time, the light is soft and warm, and the shadows are long, creating a more dramatic and interesting image. It can also be a great time to capture the city in warm and vibrant colors. Additionally, during the "blue hour" just after sunset and before sunrise, the city lights are on which gives a nice contrast and interesting visual elements to the photo.
