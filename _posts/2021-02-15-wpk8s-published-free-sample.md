I started writing a few weeks ago a book, about how to host, manage
and use **WordPress on MicroK8s**.

I managed to finish a few initial chapters, and published them as a
free sample for anyone to dive in and get an idea of what's gonna cover.

You can get the updated free sample from [Leanpub](https://bit.ly/wpk8s-leanpub).

If you are interested, subscribe using the linked page, and I would really
be grateful if you'd share a price you'd be willing to pay for such a book.

And with this step achieved, I thought I should start writing an article
with each extra step I manage to continue, providing a small version
of each new chapter created in this blog.

After the next few chapters will be ready, covering the most important
things to be able to manage WordPress in containers, I'll make the
book available to purchase early, and keep continuing to add to it,
until it will be a complete cookbook of ready to use solutions for
WordPress on containers.

As I progress with the book, the video course will follow.
