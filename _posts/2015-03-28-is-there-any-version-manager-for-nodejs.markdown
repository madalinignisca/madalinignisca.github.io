Working as a web developer it's a nice way of living.

But there are those days when you just want to bash your head of the wall.

The demand now days is changing even in corporate environment. Projects can have
the latest and greatest fancy things, even some really require things that the
competition is using.

So using modern tools, based on ruby or nodejs has become a must.

With ruby issues are like non existing - thank you [bundler](http://bundler.io/), thank you [rvm](https://rvm.io/).

But nodejs almost once a week is killing me and many others.

##Â Is there any Nodejs version manager just like RVM for ruby?
