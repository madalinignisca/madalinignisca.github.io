I moved last year in UK.

I love this country.

I wish I would have moved many years ago, but I was one of those that hoped that could still evolve in his country.

I tried over 12 years, so I would not consider myself a quiter. But reality is that in a country with high coruption and only people with interests, you can't have a good life.

So, I decided to come here, in UK. I'm thrilled how many opportunities are here for people that work and learn hard to do something with their life.
