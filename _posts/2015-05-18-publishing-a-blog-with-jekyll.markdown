While many people prefer WordPress or other blog publishing platforms, I really enjoy simplicity and prefer to have a better option when it's about hosting a website.

Static site generators have been available for a longer timeline then database driven web applications are.

There are lots of choices.

One of them is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), my preferred.

__Hosting__ can be done in many ways. Classic shared hosting or more g33ky, using Github or S3.

You are not limited only to this, you could use even Dropbox, Google Drive or any other Cloud Storage service that allows you to share a folder as a site and assign a domain to it. That means __100% free hosting__, or the lowest possible price when extreme performance is needed (try S3 + CloudFront for example).

__Security?__ It's a static website, WTF could happen? (Well, not applicable when using shared hosting)

__Complexity?__ Not so hard to start with it, if you know basic HTML/CSS, learn a bit of Markdown, you will be able to make from a full HTML template you like from __ThemeForest__ for example, a nice website easy to maintain.

__Comments?__ Just use a 3<sup>rd</sup> party service like __Disquss__ or __Facebook Comments__ and you're blowing social networks.

__External informations?__ Well, many things could be obtained using __JavaScript__.
