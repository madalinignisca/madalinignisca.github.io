In software development, a SPIKE refers to a short research task or investigation aimed at answering a specific question or proving a concept. It is often used to explore a new technology, evaluate a potential solution, or gather more information before starting a full development effort. SPIKEs are typically time-boxed and are conducted to reduce risk and uncertainty before committing to a larger development effort. The results of a SPIKE can help inform decisions and guide the direction of a project.
