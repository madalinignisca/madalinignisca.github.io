Project: Real estate agency web application with Listing management

Technologies and providers used:
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com) as main web framework
* [Github](https://github.com/features/actions) for versioning and CI
* [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/1e59420fc53f) for hosting using application platform
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [devcontainers](https://github.com/madalinignisca/devcontainers) on Docker, on any OS
* Pre-made HTML/CSS/JS templates for quick Frontend and Dashboard build

The project will be done in a rapid application development style, with scope of delivering as soon as possible
a working website for a real estate agency, trying to show how fast it can be done, some best practices to follow,
and to end in a state that could be extendended.

It will include Feature tests that ensure application would respond as expected on all endpoints.

Available soon on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MadalinIgnisca), for free.
