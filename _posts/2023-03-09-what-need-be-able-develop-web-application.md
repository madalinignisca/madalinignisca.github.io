To develop a web application, you will need:

1. Programming skills: You should have a strong understanding of programming concepts and be able to write code in programming languages commonly used for web development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
1. Familiarity with web development frameworks: You should know how to use web development frameworks such as AngularJS, React, Vue.js, Spring MVC, Ruby on Rails and Django.
1. Knowledge of databases: You need to know how to create, manipulate, and query databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or MongoDB, that can store and retrieve data for your web application.
1. Understanding of web hosting: You should have a basic understanding of web hosting and the various hosting services such as VPS, Cloud Hosting, and Shared Hosting.
1. Familiarity with version control: Knowing how to use Git, Mercurial, or SVN for version control will help you manage your code base and collaborate with other developers.
1. Web server knowledge: Understanding how web servers work and how you can configure them for your web application's needs is essential.
1. Security: Knowing how to secure your web application, protect data, and prevent attacks is critical to web development.
1. Testing and debugging skills: You need to have good testing and debugging skills to ensure the application works as expected and is free of errors or issues.
1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You will need a development environment that helps you write and test your code. Popular choices are Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains.
1. Front-end frameworks and libraries: There are many front-end frameworks and libraries available that make it easy to create user interfaces. Some popular ones include Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize, and Semantic-UI.
1. APIs and web services: If your application needs to interact with other web applications or services, you may need to use APIs or create your web services.
1. Agile development methodology: Agile is a popular software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and incremental development. Knowing how to work in an agile environment can be helpful.
1. Project Management: You will need to manage your project, schedule tasks, collaborate with others, and track progress. Popular project management tools include Trello, Asana and Jira.
1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment: You may want to automate the deployment of your application, which involves integrating code changes and automatically deploying them into a production environment. Some popular tools for CI/CD are Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI.
1. Communication Tools: To work effectively with other developers, you may need to use communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to share updates, code snippets, and collaborate in real-time.
